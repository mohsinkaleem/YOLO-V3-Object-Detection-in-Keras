This project is on Detection of common objects using State-of-art YOLO v3.
I have used pre-trained models from COCO Datasets.

In order to run my Notebook, just download the "yolov3.weights" in the right directory
and run the codes.

There are some objects which this model cannot predict and theefore does not made bounding boxex.
Its because that object is not in my Output Label.

if you have any problems contact me at-> mohsin.kaleem512@gmail.com
